# Carioca

A collection of testing tools for Android that include flexible reporting capabilities

See the project website for more information: https://rubensousa.github.io/Carioca

## Motivation for this library

1. I kept copying some of these classes around in multiple projects
2. Analysing the standard junit test reports when you have long UI tests is a frustrating task
3. Consistent screen recording and screenshots across different screen sizes
4. Flexible APIs for any test report format
5. No enforced inheritance in test classes unlike other testing libraries
